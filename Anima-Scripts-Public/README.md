# Anima-Scripts-Public
Open source scripts for medical image processing from the Empenn team

This repository includes python scripts (for execution on a standalone platform and some on an [OAR](https://oar.imag.fr) cluster). Their goal is to combine several tools from [Anima public](https://github.com/Inria-Visages/Anima-Public/) to accomplish more complex tasks (atlasing, diffusion imaging, brain extraction...).

## Installing, using and citing Anima scripts

Please refer to our [website](https://anima.irisa.fr) and the general [documentation of Anima](https://anima.rtfd.io)
